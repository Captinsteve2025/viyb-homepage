## 📊 How Scoring Works

### Total Score Calculation

```
Total Score = Must-Have Score + High Priority Score + Nice-to-Have Score + Bonus Points

Maximum Possible Score: 1,000+ points
```

### Score Breakdown Example

**Yacht A: 785 points**
- Must-Haves: 500/500 (all essential criteria met)
- High Priority: 200/250 (missing SSB radio)
- Nice-to-Have: 75/125 (has autopilot, davits, A/C)
- Bonus: 10 (recent survey)

**Yacht B: 520 points**
- Must-Haves: 400/500 (engine hours slightly high)
- High Priority: 100/250 (no watermaker or solar)
- Nice-to-Have: 0/125 (minimal extras)
- Bonus: 20 (lithium batteries)

**Result:** Yacht A ranks higher despite higher price

## 💡 Key Features That Make It "AI"

### 1. **Intelligent Weighting**
- Must-haves are deal-breakers (heavily weighted)
- High priority items significantly boost score
- Nice-to-haves provide tiebreakers

### 2. **Contextual Analysis**
- Considers combinations (e.g., watermaker + solar = self-sufficient)
- Evaluates system age vs. boat age
- Assesses completeness (e.g., navigation suite vs. individual items)

### 3. **Bonus Points Logic**
```typescript
if (yacht.systems.batteryType === 'Lithium') {
  totalScore += 20; // Modern upgrade
}

if (yacht.engines.hours < 500) {
  totalScore += 15; // Very low hours
}

if (yacht.legal.surveyAge < 1) {
  totalScore += 10; // Recent survey
}
```

### 4. **Critical Missing Features**
Shows what's missing, not just what's present:
- "Only 2 cabins (need 4)"
- "Deck condition needs improvement"
- "Not cruising ready"
