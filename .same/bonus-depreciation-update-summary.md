## Changes Made (Version 20)

### What Was Corrected

**Previous (Incorrect) Information:**
- Stated that only NEW yachts qualify
- Listed pre-owned/brokerage yachts as "Does Not Qualify"
- Implied used yachts cannot get bonus depreciation

**Updated (Correct) Information:**
- Both NEW and USED yachts CAN qualify for bonus depreciation
- Pre-owned/brokerage yachts are now listed as "Qualifies"
- Clarified the ACTUAL disqualifiers

## Updated Section: "Asset Purchase Requirement"

### Changed Title
**From:** "New Equipment Requirement"
**To:** "Asset Purchase Requirement"

### Updated Description
**Now reads:**
> "The yacht must be purchased (not leased) and placed into active charter or business service. Both new and pre-owned yachts can qualify for bonus depreciation when used for legitimate business purposes."

### What QUALIFIES ✅
- ✅ New Bali catamarans
- ✅ **Pre-owned/brokerage yachts** (ADDED)
- ✅ Purchased assets (not leased)

### What DOES NOT QUALIFY ❌
- ❌ Personal/recreational use only

## Files Updated

1. **`/src/app/bonus-depreciation/page.tsx`**
   - Main React/Next.js page
   - Qualification requirement #2 corrected

2. **`wordpress-export/bonus-depreciation.html`**
   - WordPress export HTML
   - Same changes applied

## Why This Matters

This is a critical correction because:

1. **Expands eligible buyers:** Pre-owned yacht buyers can also benefit from bonus depreciation
2. **Accurate tax information:** Ensures clients get correct guidance
3. **Business focus:** Clarifies that the KEY factor is business use, not whether the yacht is new
4. **Brokerage opportunity:** VIYB can now promote tax benefits for BOTH new Bali sales AND brokerage listings

---

## Key Takeaway

**The determining factors for bonus depreciation are:**
1. ✅ Purchased (not leased)
2. ✅ More than 50% business use
3. ✅ Placed in active charter/business service

**NOT:**
- ❌ Whether the yacht is new or used
